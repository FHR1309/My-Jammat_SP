#My Jamaat App

###Description
Muslims pray five times a day and some do so in masjids. To track the prayer times in different masjids 
and the regularity of a persons prayer many feel the necessity of an app that can help them to locate masjids 
and their prayer times. They will also maintain their personal data of prayer if they want so. Also a new people 
in the locality will find the nearby masjids and their respective prayer times.
